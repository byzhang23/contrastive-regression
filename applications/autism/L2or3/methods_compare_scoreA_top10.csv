"NRXN3",19,9,947,983,"Neurexins are a family of proteins that function in the vertebrate nervous system as cell adhesion molecules and receptors. NRXN3 is one of the largest known human genes. It utilizes two alternate promoters and includes numerous alternatively spliced exons to generate thousands of distinct mRNA transcripts and protein isoforms. The majority of transcripts are produced from the upstream promoter and encode alpha-neurexin isoforms; a much smaller number of transcripts are produced from the downstream promoter and encode beta-neurexin isoforms.","Rare Single Gene variant"
